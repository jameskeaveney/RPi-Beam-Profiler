about_message = " Raspberry Pi Beam Profiler 1.0 \n\n \
Uses Raspberry Pi NOIR CCD camera (with the stock lens removed) \
to analyse the spatial size of a beam as a function of \
translation distance along the beam axis. \n\n\
With this, it should be possible to do: \n\
  -- Knife-edging in 2D over many Rayleigh ranges \n\
  -- M-squared measurements \n\
  -- Collimation testing \n\n\
This program was written entirely in Python with a few extensions: \n\
numpy, scipy (numerics and fitting), matplotlib (plotting), wxpython (GUI), picamera, RPi.GPIO \n\n\
User manual is available from GitHub:\n\
